"1","Nothing Was the Same"," tuscan leather "," Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record Just to off these records, nigga that's a record I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure Past the present when you have to mention This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go Heavy airplay all day with no chorus We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga I could go a hour on this beat, nigga I'm just as famous as my mentor But that's still the boss, don't get sent for Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more Hot temper, scary outcome Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one That always let they mouth run Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin' like a brick Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin' I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin' On a mission tryna shift the culture Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin' All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure Like aye, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace My life's a completed checklist I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now That's real How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro? Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna (talk to 'em) The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie All these 90's fantasies on my mind The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time I might come through without security to check if you're fine That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO Wanted to tell you, ""Accept yourself"" You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help You know, back on your feet and shit Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro? How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though? Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro? If there's hell below. I'll see you when you get there. Are you enjoyin' yourselves? If we may we'd just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational. Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years. It don't mean that we can't have a good life. So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us"

Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love You shouldn't have to deal with that I'd never make you feel like that, cause... I love me, I love me enough for the both of us That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of? Darling you, you give but you cannot take love I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different Started realizing a couple places I could take it I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation And influence a generation that's lacking in patience I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience Just me and my old man getting back to basics We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us We even talked about you and our couple of moments He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone Looking like you came from the 70's on your own My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone? You don't even know what you want from love anymore I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh? I love me, I love me enough for the both of us That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of? Darling you, you give but you cannot take love Thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it Cause that night I played her three songs Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment? Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven It seem like you don't want this love anymore I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh? I love me, I love me enough for the both of us That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of? Darling you, you give but you cannot take love ""Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G Been a East Side ting Scarborough ting from time, G Been have up di ting dem from time, G So I don't know what's wrong with these Little wasteman out here eh?
